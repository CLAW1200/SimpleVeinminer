# Cyan's Veinminer
 A Simple Veinminer for Fabric

I recently started playing with a few mods on 1.18.1

It was pretty fun but I got way too used with veinmining on other modpacks

So, I looked for a veinminer for 1.18.1 fabric and... Nothing (Well there's [VeinMiner4Bukkit](VeinMiner4Bukkit) and [Vein Mining (Fabric)](Vein Mining Fabric "Fine I'll do it myself") but neither do what I needed)

So, taking a page from Thanos' book, I did it myself

![A meme showing no results for "veinminer" in fabric 1.18.1 on the first part and Thanos saying "Fine, I'll do it myself" on the second](THANOS_MEME)

This Is my first actual mod (I've made one for learning purposes before), so some feedback would be appreciated

# Configs
Veinmining is usually quite OP so to balance it a bit, I made the exhaustion (how hungry the player gets) be based on the block's hardness

So, veinming a bunch of obsidian makes you hungrier than veinmining the same amount of stone or dirt

But I know everyone plays differently so the configs allow you to adjust exhaustion and durability usage

I suggest using [Mod Menu](Mod menu) and [Cloth Config](Cloth Config) for that, but both are optional

I suggest messing around with the configs a bit to find what fits you best

# Modpacks
You can add this to how many modpacks as you would like.
