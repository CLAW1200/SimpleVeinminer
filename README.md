# Cyan's Veinminer

### The config file for v1.1.1+ is now simple_veinminer.conf

I recently started playing with a few mods on 1.18.1

It was pretty fun but I got way too used with veinmining on other modpacks

So, I looked for a veinminer for 1.18.1 fabric and... Nothing (Well there's [VeinMiner4Bukkit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/veinminer4bukkit) and [Vein Mining (Fabric)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vein-mining-fabric) but neither do what I needed)

So, taking a page from Thanos' book, I did it myself

![A meme showing no results for "veinminer" in fabric 1.18.1 ontop and Thanos saying "Fine, I'll do it myself", but with my profile picture (A white girl with long brown curly hair and brown eyes, a golden crown, blue earrings, a pink jumper, a flower crown and glasses) edited in place of his face below](https://github.com/PrincessCyanMarine/Simple-Veinminer/blob/main/assets/fine_ill_do_it_myself.png?raw=true "Fine I'll do it myself")

This Is my first actual mod, so some feedback would be appreciated


# Enchantments and multiplayer

I haven't tested any modded enchantments (yet), but the vanilla ones seem work correctly

It should work on multiplayer, but I haven't tested that yet

# Config

Veinmining is usually quite OP so to balance it a bit, I made the exhaustion (how hungry the player gets) be based on the block's hardness

So, veinming a bunch of obsidian makes you hungrier than veinmining the same amount of stone or dirt

But I know everyone plays differently so the configs allow you to adjust exhaustion, durability usage and the maximum amount of blocks that can be veinmined at once

I suggest messing around with the configs a bit to find what fits you best

The easiest way to do that is by using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config), but both are optional

# Modpacks

You can add this to as many modpacks as you would like.
